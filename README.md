# COMM4190 – A/B Conversations with an LLM  
### Exploring Product Identity, Empathy, and Marketing Futures

> *“Every test is a conversation with possibility.”*


## 💡 Concept

The experiment compares **two speculative advertising campaigns** designed around the theme of *“the self in dialogue with time.”*

- **Product A – Echoes of Tomorrow**  
  A futuristic campaign about identity, branching timelines, and digital empathy.  
  It imagines technology as a mirror through which users explore alternate versions of themselves.

- **Product B – Afterlight**  
  A reflective, emotionally grounded campaign about reassurance and continuity.  
  It envisions users conversing with their older selves — not to predict the future, but to understand it.

The dialogue between the **Student** and the **LLM** evolves into a synthesis:  
a new product that combines the vision of Echoes with the humanity of Afterlight.

## 🧠 Methodology

The project employed **LLM-mediated comparative reasoning**:
1. Load two campaign concepts (A/B).  
2. Simulate structured evaluation through `query_LLM()` calls.  
3. Compare narrative, tone, visual identity, and emotional effect.  
4. Merge strongest attributes into a hybrid product.  
5. Output final recommendations and campaign materials.

This process demonstrates how **AI dialogue** can serve as a co-creative partner, not just an evaluator.

## 🧭 Key Takeaways

- A/B testing can evolve from quantitative metrics to **qualitative meaning-making**.  
- Marketing can be both **analytical** and **empathetic** when mediated by LLMs.  
- The future of communication isn’t just predictive — it’s **reflective**.
